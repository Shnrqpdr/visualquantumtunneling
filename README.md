# visualquantumtunneling
The principal objective of this project is provide a clear visualization of a wave packet crossing a potential barrier on quantum tunneling.  

Given a one-dimensional time dependent Schr√∂dinger equation representing a wavefunction, it's possible to use the Split-Step Fourier Method to find its solution. On Optics context, it can be known as BPM (beam propagation method). Both Fourier Transform and Inverse Fourier Transform are actively used on this method. Since Numpy provides a module with the Fast Fourier Transform, this packet has been pretty much applied in our project.
